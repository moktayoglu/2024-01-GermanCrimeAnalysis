#### Data Literacy Project W23/24

This project aims to enhance our comprehension of crime, a crucial step in its prevention and prediction, thereby alleviating societal burdens. Focusing on German crime data spanning 1976 to 2020, we utilized clustering methods to unveil relationships among criminal activities. Notably, after identifying a peak in 2007 correlated with the Great Recession, we explored economic factors for improved explainability.

We collected the crime rates from [Destatis](https://www-genesis.destatis.de/genesis//online?operation=table&code=24311-0001&bypass=true&levelindex=1&levelid=1706538901950#abreadcrumb)
and the economic data from [the World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/country/germany).
